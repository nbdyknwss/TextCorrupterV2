TextCorrupterV2

This is the second version of a text corrupter I coded. It will ask for input, take your input and add different unicode characters to make it
look "corrupted." It is coded in C# and should be easy for any beginner like me to read through and understand.

As for installation, I will try to help with any issues with it that are reported in the issues tab, but it should be fairly straightforward. It will work on Windows 
systems, but I am not entirely sure about other platforms.

"Corrupted" text can have adverse effects on some programs due to them not being able to read the input, so use with that in mind.

I have no license attached, as this is not an innovative idea and is done by many websites. Take it, mod it, do whatever 
your little heart desires.
